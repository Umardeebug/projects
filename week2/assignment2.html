          Black Clover (Japanese: ブラッククローバー, Hepburn: Burakku Kurōbā)
          is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yūki Tabata. The
          story follows Asta, a young boy born without any magic power. This is
          unknown to the world he lives in because seemingly everyone has some
          sort of magic power. With his fellow mages from the Black Bulls, Asta
          plans to become the next Wizard King. It has been serialized in
          Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine since February 2015, with its
          chapters collected in 32 tankōbon volumes as of April 2022.

      The series focuses on Asta, a young orphan who is left to be raised in an
      orphanage alongside his fellow orphan, Yuno. While everyone is born with
      the ability to utilize mana in the form of magical power, Asta, with no
      magic however, instead focuses on physical strength. Conversely, Yuno was
      born as a prodigy with immense magical power and the talent to control
      wind magic.
