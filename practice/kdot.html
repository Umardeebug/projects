        Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper,
        songwriter, and record producer. He is often cited as one of the most
        influential rappers of his generation. Aside from his solo career, he is
        also a member of the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy alongside his former
        Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) labelmates Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and Schoolboy
        Q. Raised in Compton, California, Lamar embarked on his musical career
        as a teenager under the stage name K.Dot, releasing a mixtape titled
        Y.H.N.I.C. (Hub City Threat Minor of the Year) that garnered local
        attention and led to his signing with indie record label TDE. He began
        to gain recognition in 2010 after his first retail release, Overly
        Dedicated. The following year, he independently released his first
        studio album, Section.80, which included his debut single "HiiiPoWeR".
