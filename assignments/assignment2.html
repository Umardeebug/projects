        Black Clover (Japanese: ブラッククローバー, Hepburn: Burakku Kurōbā) is
        a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yūki Tabata. The
        story follows Asta, a young boy born without any magic power. This is
        unknown to the world he lives in because seemingly everyone has some
        sort of magic power. With his fellow mages from the Black Bulls, Asta
        plans to become the next Wizard King. It has been serialized in
        Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine since February 2015, with its
        chapters collected in 32 tankōbon volumes as of April 2022.

        The series focuses on Asta, a young orphan who is left to be raised in
        an orphanage alongside his fellow orphan, Yuno. While everyone is born
        with the ability to utilize mana in the form of magical power, Asta,
        with no magic however, instead focuses on physical strength. Conversely,
        Yuno was born as a prodigy with immense magical power and the talent to
        control wind magic.
